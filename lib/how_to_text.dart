const howToText = "To minimize the storage of sensitive information in memory as much as possible, the app requires you to enter a password each time you lock, unlock, create, or delete a note. This approach prioritizes security over convenience, ensuring that your data remains well-protected and reducing the risk of unauthorized access. Additionally, to help preserve your notes, they are automatically exported every time you make a change. This ensures that your data is always backed up and accessible when needed. You can disable this feature in the settings.";
